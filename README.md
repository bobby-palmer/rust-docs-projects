# My Rust intro projects
This repository will contain all projects I complete as part of the tutorials in "The Rust Programming Language".  
All projects except [Hello World](#hello-world) can be run by executing `cargo run` inside their respective directories.  
## The Projects  
1. [Hello World](#hello-world)
2. [Hello Cargo](#hello-cargo)  
3. [Guessing Game](#guessing-game)
4. [Variables](#variables)
5. [Adder](#adder)
6. [Grep CLI](#grep-cli)

## Hello World
Just your basic hello world script.  
## Hello Cargo
First introduction to cargo, the rust build system and package manager.  
## Guessing Game
Learned how to import std library functions and external dependencies. Also introduced to strong static variable types and the rust match function.  
## Variables
Learning concepts of variables, functions, comments, and control flow that are common between Rust and most other languages.  
## Adder
Learning how to write automatic library tests in Rust.  
## Grep CLI
Applied principals learned up to this point to make a command line interface for a grep program that searches and returns all lines that contain a given string.
